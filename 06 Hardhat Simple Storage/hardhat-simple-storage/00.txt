start with yarn hardhat

hardhat.config.js is the entry point of the folder

01 deploying simpleStorage.sol in hardhat
    // simply use: yarn hardhat compile

    After compiling next task is to create deploy script.
    // using built in hardhat/ethers file since then hardhat,
    is able to manage all deployments and compilations.

    to deploy:
    yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js


02 networks in hardhat: 8:41:45
    hardhat by default gives hardhat blockchain network.
    adding goerli network to hardhat.config.js

$ yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli

    We can go to etherscan and after seeing our transaction,
    we can also verify the contract if we want.
    With hardhat we can do it from our code editor also.
    verifying and publishing contract
    using hardhat-etherscan plugin

    require etherscan plugin in hardhat.config.js
    then verify function will be added to the
    hardhat terminal menu.

    in deploy.js, write code which starts verifying
    the contract if chainId === 5 and etherscan api exists.

03 Interacting with contracts on hardhat: 9:06:38
$ yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli

04 custom hardhat tasks
    creating a task in hardhat
    // can either use tasks or scripts.

05 hardhat localhost node

$ yarn hardhat node 
// it spins up a local blockchain network like ganache
for localhost, first add localhost in network inside hardhat.config.json
and to run 
$ yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

 
06 the hardhat console => 9:23:12
$ yarn hardhat console --network localhost

// can use console to run code and do anything

07 Running tests

    tests can be run by:
    $ yarn hardhat test 

    to run an individual test 
    $ yarn hardhat test --grep keyword-only-present-in-that-describe-test-string 

    or by doing 

    it.only in front of the test you want to run

    // assert and expect do the same things

08 Hardhat gas reporter
    // can be used with command $ yarn hardhat test
    // output added in gitignore

09 Solidity Coverage: hardhat-plugin
    // // output added in gitignore
