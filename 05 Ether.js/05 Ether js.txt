// local setup
    can either compile contracts in our code
    or compile them separately

    after copying SimpleStorage.sol contract, install solc to 
    compile the contract and open Ganache to get local blockchain network.

    Ganache and Networks
        In Remix IDE We were deploying either on Javascript VM or a 
        test network.
        Now we will see how to do it, here



    Copying Remote Procedure Call URL (RPC) from ganache 

    We will be using Ether.js which is a wrapper to make API calls
    for deploying and other stuff

    after writing the code for deploying, we can see that the code deployed
    successfully

7:10:24 Adding Transaction Overrides
    In the ContractFactory.deploy({gasLimit, gasPrice})
    // a js object can be passed

    02 Sending a "raw" Transaction in ethersjs

    03 Interacting with Contracts in Ethersjs

    04 Environment Variables

    05 Securing private key:
        either add .env Variables before node deploy.js 
        or 
        make a file encrypt.js with script to encrypt env vars.


        history -c // to clear terminal history

    06 Optional Prettier Formatting, creating .prettierrc file simple

    07 Deploying to a Testnet or a Mainnet

    08 Verifying on the Block Explorers
    we can add contract code to etherscan as did on address
