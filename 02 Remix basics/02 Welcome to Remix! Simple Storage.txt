2:09 need to read how licenses work

solidity language basics
contract => class

pure functions?

public variable implicitly get assigned a function
that returns its values

default visibility is internal

view and pure functions, when called alone don't 
spend gas 

Gas is only used, when we make some modification to
the blockchain

view functions => disallow modification state;
 also disallow you to read from blockchain state

EVM overview:
EVM can access and store info in 6 places:
Stack; Memory; Storage; Calldata; Code; Logs

calldata: temp var without update permission
          temp var that cannot be modified

memory: temp var with update permission
        temp var that can be modified
        
storage: not temp, default forms of initialized variables

EVM => Ethereum Virtual Machine
// ex: Avalanche, Fantom, Polygon
