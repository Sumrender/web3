2:09 need to read how licenses work

solidity language basics
contract => class

pure functions => disallow modification or access
                of state
view functions => disallow modification of state        

public variable implicitly get assigned a function
that returns its values

default visibility is internal

view and pure functions, when called alone don't 
spend gas 
but cost gas when called inside a gas using function

// DATA TYPES 
string, uint256, int256, bool, bytes???

// Creating an array of struct people
struct People {
        uint256 favNumber;
        string name;
}

People[] public people;

// MAPPING
mapping(string => uint256) public nameToFavNum;

Gas is only used, when we make some modification to
the blockchain

EVM overview:
EVM can access and store info in 6 places:
Stack; Memory; Storage; Calldata; Code; Logs

calldata: temp var without update permission
          temp var that cannot be modified

memory: temp var with update permission
        temp var that can be modified
        
storage: not temp, default forms of initialized variables

struct, mapping, arrays, strings require memory/calldata
to be given when passed as parameters

EVM => Ethereum Virtual Machine
// ex: Avalanche, Fantom, Polygon
